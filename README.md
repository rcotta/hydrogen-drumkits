# hydrogen-drumkits

You'll find on this repository Hydrogen drumkits adjusted/customized for specific electronic drums.

The repository is organized in folders, with electronic drums brand/model names.

**IMPORTANT**: note that, to use these kits, the option "Options > Preferences > Midi system > Use output note as input note" must be checked, otherwise the MIDI note x instrument custom mapping does not have effect.

Please, feel free to contribute with additional kits for Alesis Nitromesh and other electronic drums!
